<p>With over forty combined years of treating patients in our clinics we’ve learned what works best for patients suffering from elbow tendonitis. We’ve found instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) to be one of the most effective clinical treatments available for tennis and golfer’s elbow.  IASTM has been performed in physical therapy clinics worldwide for over a decade with proven results.  The drawbacks, however, of this clinical treatment include health insurance restrictions, deductibles and co-pays; plus the time commitment and difficulty adhering to a consistent schedule of therapy appointments two or three times weekly for eight or more weeks.

We knew the therapy worked but the clinic was the obstacle keeping people from having success.  The Fiix Elbow eliminates that obstacle and gives people the same great therapy in the convenience of their home.  It’s easy to stay on track with our app-driven treatment plan. It’s simple, straightforward, and requires just minutes a day. With our system, you don't need to drive to the clinic and wait in line for an appointment. Instead, you'll be able to track your progress and get daily, measurable results far beyond what is possible in a traditional clinic.

We took our clinical experience and packaged it into The Fiix Elbow so people can get the most effective elbow pain relief in the easiest way possible.  Our surveys show that 92% of our customers are completing  the entire 8-week program.  That stat is truly amazing in the world of physical therapy and is what drives us at Fiix Body.  

We built a better path to fiix elbow tendonitis.  Simple. Effective. Convenient. Guaranteed.
